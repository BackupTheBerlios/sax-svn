# Single Head profile for ATI ("fglrx") driver
# --------------------------------------------
#
#  Usage: sax2 -m 0=fglrx -b /usr/X11R6/lib/sax/profile/FGLRX_SingleHead
#
# Use the "fglrxconfig" program for setting up a Multihead 
# configuration with the ATI ("fglrx") driver.

# Remove device/desktop for Screen 1, which might have been applied by
# the Radeon Multihead profile before. Needs to be done, since we 
# don't want to create a configuration mix with radeon/fglrx drivers,
# which simply doesn't work.
