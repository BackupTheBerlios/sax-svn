# How to use the guitest script for
# testing your translations...
# --

1) Install the SaX2 package 
2) Allow root to access the X-Server

   xhost +

2) switch the user to root
 
   su root

3) Change the directory to:

   /usr/X11R6/lib/sax/doc/

4) Call guitest:

   ./guitest <your .po file>

Notes:
------

- It is not possible to test the help text within this script
  because the help text .txt file is outside the .po file during
  your test phase. There is no need to test the help text 
  because there are no geometry problems expected

- You need to name your .po file with a full qualified 
  locale name in it. For example:

  sax.en_US.po 
  sax.fr_FR.po

  sax.fr.po ---> is wrong and will lead to an us outfit

Samples:
--------

  ./guitest /tmp/sax.fr_FR.po
